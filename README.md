Search Engine
=================================================
Multi threaded search engine in Java to emulate Grep-like functionalities. Queries files with Regex pattern to recurisvely search through directories and subdirectories. Then uses a work queue to build an inverted index that can be searched through with partial and exact search functionalities. The inverted index stores word count, word frequency, and file path location from the searched directories in Json format.
